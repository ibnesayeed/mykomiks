<h2 class="img-title">The Who's Who, What's What and Why's Why</h2>

<p>I am sure you will be happy to be a part of our komik world, and I will be happy to be a part of your world. Anyways, I am Manish Wadhwa, and you may also call me "M". I am working towards my Doctorate in Electrical Engineering from Old Dominion University. Side effects of PhD are brutal sometimes, and that's where we end up sometimes, the world of komiks. Tragedy is the mother of komedy, you see. I am not this weird in my real life, and I am as abnormal as all of you are.</p>

<h3>How frequent?</h3>

<p>I really can't promise, but you may expect it every Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday! We encourage you to subscribe to the syndicated alerts (RSS/Facebook/Twitter).</p>

<h3>How did it start?</h3>

<p>This komik series started with my growing interest in drawing stick figures and creating komiks from talks with my friends in my lab. The idea grew and I started creating more komik strips. And here you see an obvious side-effect or defect. The idea is growing and I am sure I will be able to bring out lot more creative energy through these komiks.</p>

<h3>Where to reach me?</h3>

<p>I can be reached at m@mykomiks.com.</p>

<h3>The Culprit Working Behind the Scenes</h3>

<p>Sawood Alam, who is a great friend of mine, is helping me with site maintenance and design. He is amazing, always ready with his loads of ideas and suggestions. He can be reached at s@mykomiks.com.</p>

<h3>More Later</h3>

<p>You see, I am just starting!!!</p>
